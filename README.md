# NBA-salary-analysis

As part of the final project for Regression and Time Series Analysis for Data Science course 16:954:596 @Rutgers.
We made this project for analyzing NBA players salaries using the data from https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries
We tried to fit a linear model using various features of players such as points and their demographics, etc. 
to predict their salary and reached 66% accuracy.
